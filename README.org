* Usage

Call ~starhugger-complete~ or ~starhugger-complete-using-from-buffer-begininng~ directly or bind to your key(s) of choice.

The performance may not be great, but there are asynchronous so Emacs won't be blocked.

The first call usually doesn't return the completed code as expected, you can call the command successively, or enable ~(starhugger-global-mode)~ and press TAB to repeat.

Remember to set ~starhugger-api-token~ (from https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens), otherwise you may easily get hit by the limit rate.
